## **---------------------------------------------------------------------------Praan Project------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

*I have understood the task very well!!*
**Just because _ExpressJS with Typescript_ as the primary requirement of this task, i couldn't proceed further.**

Even then, I have done whatever i am well versed with i.e **_MongoDB_**.
>> We can filter out the values of pm1, pm2.5, and pm10 by running the mongodb query at the backend.
>> By providing an option to the user to select the time duration, we can filter that particular data using query.

## **Idea which i thought could be implemented**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Create a frontend webpage for user using CSS/HTML/JS.
- Allow the user to select/filter the options,then route them to a new page to show the desired output, _at the backend **_API will be called_**. 
- We can **create the API** very easily using **_Flask_** framework & route on different attractive output pages for the output.
- Furthermore, for all this setup we can create **_Docker image_** and deploy the environment in **_K8s Multinode Cluster_**. 
- Additionally, we can create the **_k8s cluster in AWS_** .

I am more into DevOps Tools, Just because i have never used ExpressJS with TypeScript,i could hardly even start the task, and it didn't looked quite well to just copy the task from somewhere. 

**Note:** But I can assure, if ExpressJS will also be needed as a part of the intern's journey at Praan, then i am ready to learn it quickly.
